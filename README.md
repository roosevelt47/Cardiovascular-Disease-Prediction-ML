# Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-ML
This project focuses on developing predictive models to assess the likelihood of cardiovascular disease (CVD) based on clinical and demographic factors. Using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, we implemented and evaluated multiple machine learning models to classify patients as at-risk or not.
